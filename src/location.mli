(** Module for handling source code locations. *)

type span
(** Source location ranges in source programs. *)

type 'a t
(** A node tagged with location data. *)

val show_spans: bool ref
(** Flag for whether or not the pretty printer should display spans as well. *)

val make_span : Lexing.position -> Lexing.position -> span
(** [make_span start finish] creates a new span from two lexer positions.  *)

val span_of_lexbuf : Lexing.lexbuf -> span
(** [span_of_lexbuf lexbuf] gets the location range from current lexer buffer and creates
    a new span from it. *)

val locate : ?s:span -> 'a -> 'a t
(** [locate ?s x m] wraps a value [x] with an optional location range [s]. *)

val mk : Lexing.position * Lexing.position -> 'a -> 'a t
(** [mk pos x] creates a node tagged with location data given a pair of [Lexing.position]
    and a node [x]. *)
